2. Efficient indexing and search functionalities to facilitate quick retrieval of relevant legal documents.
3. Support for various document formats, such as text, PDF, and HTML.
4. Version control mechanisms to track changes and updates to legal documents over time.
5. User-friendly interface for browsing, searching, and accessing legal research materials.
6. Secure access control to ensure data privacy and integrity.
7. Scalability to accommodate a growing collection of legal materials and users.
